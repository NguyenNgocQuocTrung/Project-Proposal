I want to build a Front-end only application with only javascript, don't use typescript for hotel management, with the main features as follows:

Room Booking: Hotel staff use the system to search for available rooms, enter customer information (name, phone number, stay dates, etc.), select room type, and confirm the booking on behalf of the guest, usually based on requests via phone, email, or at the reception desk.

Room Cancellation: Staff receive cancellation requests from guests (by phone, email, or directly), check the cancellation policy in the system, process the cancellation, inform the guest of the result, and handle refunds if applicable.

Check-out: Staff complete the guestâ€™s stay by reviewing the booking information, calculating the final bill (including any extra service charges), processing payment, and updating the room status to "available" after confirmation from the guest, ensuring a quick and accurate process.

Create Rental Voucher: Staff enter customer details (name, phone number, ID documents, etc.) into the system, select the appropriate room type, and create a rental voucher containing information such as check-in/check-out dates, price, and additional services. Upon completion, the system automatically updates the room status from "available" to "occupied," ensuring information accuracy and timely room management. This feature supports guest tracking and subsequent activities like payment and check-out.

Room Information Lookup: Staff search and check room information based on criteria such as room number, room type (single, double, suite, etc.), or status (available, occupied, under maintenance). Staff enter the search criteria, and the system displays detailed results, including current status and guest information (if occupied). This helps staff quickly grasp room situations, assist room assignment, maintenance management, and handle guest requests effectively and accurately.

Create Payment Invoice: Staff calculate the total charges based on room rental duration and additional services (such as meals, laundry, etc.). They access the booking information, and the system automatically aggregates charges, applies any discounts, and generates a detailed invoice including guest name, itemized charges, total amount due, and payment method. After invoice creation, staff can print or email the invoice to the guest, ensuring a transparent, accurate, and convenient payment process.

Invoice Search: Staff search for customer invoices based on criteria such as invoice number, guest name, issuance date, or booking code. Upon entering the information, the system displays invoice details, including room and service charges, total amount, payment method, and status (paid or unpaid). This feature helps staff quickly verify transactions, answer guest inquiries, or support financial reconciliation, ensuring transparent and efficient invoice management.

Add Room: Management can add new room information to the database. Staff input details like room number, room type (single, double, suite, etc.), and initial status (available, maintenance), along with other necessary information. Upon confirmation, the system updates the room list, expanding management capabilities and meeting customer demands. This feature ensures flexible adjustments to the hotel's facilities and keeps data accurate and synchronized.

Edit Room: Management can update and edit room information as needed. Staff access the room list, select the room to be edited, and change information like room number, room type (e.g., from single to double), or status (available, occupied), along with other details (price, amenities). After confirmation, the system saves the changes, ensuring room information is always accurate and reflects reality. This supports flexible operational adjustments based on facility or management needs.

Update Room Information: Management adjusts room details, including room number, type (single, double, suite, etc.), and status (available, occupied). Staff access room information in the system, input or edit data as necessary, such as changing the status from "available" to "under maintenance," or updating room type after upgrades. Once saved, the system synchronizes the new information to ensure data accuracy and effective room management.

Add Service: Management allows the addition of services like spa, laundry, or airport transfer easily. Users can input service information, customize pricing, link it to customer profiles, manage inventory, and integrate the services into payment invoices. This not only enhances customer experience but also supports revenue tracking and optimized management.

Edit Service: Management enables editing service information such as name, price, description, or category (e.g., spa, dining). Users can update service details, adjust prices over time, relink them to customer profiles, or modify inventory status if needed. This ensures service information remains accurate and flexible, meeting customer needs and supporting better management.

Delete Service: Management allows the removal of services that are no longer provided, like spa, laundry, or airport transfer, from the list. Users select the service to delete, confirm the action to ensure no disruption to current bookings, and the system updates immediately. This keeps the service list clean, accurate, and avoids customer confusion.

Feedback and Complaint Management: This feature helps the system receive and process feedback or complaints from guests. Users can submit reflections about room quality, services, or staff behavior. Management will review, categorize, and respond to guests based on status: newly submitted, in progress, resolved. This enables the hotel to improve service quality based on actual guest evaluations.

The data can be pre-created, but please write services that call APIs for me, including Redux setup to store access tokens
